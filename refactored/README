A refactor of the analysis created in the Astronomical Data in Python tutorial with the goals of:
 - creating a more coherent program
 - completing the analysis for the entire stream


Goal:
 - create a map of stars in GD1 stellar stream

Strategy:
 - select stars in the region of the stream using the Koposov coordinate frame
 - identfy an overdensity cooresponding to the GD1 stars
 - fit the stars to an appropriate isochrone and filter to nearby stars in the CMD
